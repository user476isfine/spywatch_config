# Spy watch config

I made this because I was bored.

The text file format for certain spy watches contains some non-intuitive fields that one must manually edit. This is a VERY simple script and I donâ€™t intend to support additional features.

Note: This project has nothing to do with any inappropriate use of spy watches that go against the law. I just searched for its configuration and automated it. Use it at your own discretion and at your own risk (which really seems to be very low IMO).
